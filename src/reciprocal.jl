    get_ir_reciprocal_mesh(cell::Cell, mesh, is_shift=falses(3); is_time_reversal=true, symprec=1e-5)

Return k-points mesh and k-point map to the irreducible k-points.

Irreducible reciprocal grid points are searched from uniform
mesh grid points specified by `mesh` and `is_shift`.
`mesh` stores three integers. Reciprocal primitive vectors
are divided by the number stored in `mesh` with (0,0,0) point
centering. The centering can be shifted only half of one mesh
by setting `1` or `true` for each `is_shift` element. If `0` or `false` is set for
`is_shift`, it means there is no shift. This limitation of
shifting enables the irreducible k-point search significantly
faster when the mesh is very dense.

The reducible uniform grid points are returned in reduced
coordinates as `grid_address`. A map between reducible and
irreducible points are returned as `grid_mapping_table` as in the indices of
`grid_address`. The number of the irreducible k-points are
returned as the return value. The time reversal symmetry is
imposed by setting `is_time_reversal`.

!!! compat "Version 0.2"
    The returned mapping table is indexed starting at `1`, not `0` as in Python or C.
